**SupSub** is an Obsidian plugin that allows you to easily wrap the selected text with `<sup>` and `<sub>` tags, enabling quick formatting of superscripts and subscripts in your notes.

## Usage

- To wrap the selected text with superscript tags, use the hotkey `Option + Command + '='`.
- To wrap the selected text with subscript tags, use the hotkey `Option + Command + '-'`.
- If the selected text is already wrapped with the corresponding tags, using the hotkey will remove the tags.
