**SupSub** is an Obsidian plugin that allows you to easily format selected text with `<sup>` and `<sub>` tags, enabling quick superscript and subscript formatting in your notes.

## What's New in Version 1.0.2 (@2024-09-08)

- **Cursor Positioning**: Now, if you use the hotkeys without selecting any text, the cursor will be positioned between the newly inserted `<sup>` or `<sub>` tags, allowing you to start typing immediately.
- **Enhanced Toggle Behavior**: The plugin still allows you to toggle superscript and subscript formatting. If the selected text is already wrapped in the respective tags, pressing the hotkey will remove the tags.

## Usage

- **Superscript**: Use the hotkey `Option + Command + '='` on macOS or `Ctrl + Alt + '='` on Windows to wrap the selected text with `<sup>` tags. If no text is selected, the cursor will be placed between the `<sup></sup>` tags.
- **Subscript**: Use the hotkey `Option + Command + '-'` on macOS or `Ctrl + Alt + '-'` on Windows to wrap the selected text with `<sub>` tags. If no text is selected, the cursor will be placed between the `<sub></sub>` tags.
- **Toggling**: If the selected text is already wrapped in `<sup>` or `<sub>`, using the hotkey will remove the tags.
