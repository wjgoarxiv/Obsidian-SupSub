# obsidian-supsub

The **Obsidian SupSub Plugin** provides a convenient way to wrap selected text with `<sup>` and `<sub>` tags, allowing you to easily format __superscripts__ and __subscripts__ in your notes.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release of the plugin from the [Releases](https://github.com/wjgoarxiv/obsidian-supsub/releases) page.
2. Copy the `main.js` file and `manifest.json` file to your Obsidian vault's plugins directory. 
3. Enable the plugin in the Obsidian settings under "Community Plugins".

## Usage

- To wrap selected text with superscript tags, use the `Option + Command + '='` hotkey.
- To wrap selected text with subscript tags, use the `Option + Command + '-'` hotkey.
- If the selected text is already wrapped with the tags, using the hotkey will de-bracket the text.
